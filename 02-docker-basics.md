# Docker basic commands 

Before getting into specific Docker functionalities it is important that you become familiar with the Docker main commands. This because in many cases you will have to interact manually with your containers in tasks such as listing the current running apps and built images, executing non-primary commands into those containers, reading logs, taging and pushing images to remote repos, etc. In addition, Docker is mostly managed from CLI and this is really relevant every time you get a new project which makes use of this approach.

To complete this, here are some questions that might help you get an idea of whether skip or not this step:
1. Have you ever pulled an image pubished on the Docker hub?
2. Have you used *docker run* for executing any container?
3. How do you run a container in background?
4. Can you expose and map ports between a Docker container and your host machine?
5. How can you read a docker container's logs and debug whether something is going wrong?
6. Could you run and interact with a multi-command container such as redis? 
7.  Do you know how to build a Docker image including tag names, environtment variables, build args, resource constraints, etc.?

**Note**: This challenge is optional. Feel free to skip it if you are comfortable with Docker CLI commands.

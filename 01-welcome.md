# Welcome

An *agile delivery culture* such as DevOps requires to be continuously evolving. It implies that many tecnologies will emerge for the sake of increasing the efficiency throughout the process of development and operations. Because of that, this ramp-up is meant to encourage you to improve your skills with containerization and orchestration.

First, Docker has become popular since it reduces significantly the amount of repetitive configuration tasks, giving us the advantage of having an easy-to-run and portable application development. Once you are completely familiar with the Docker ecosystem, you will encounter a multi-container application which will need a great effort in orchestration. Here is where Kubernetes brings its power automating the deployment, scaling and management of those containers.

Following the same methodology used for other ramp-ups on this platform, this brings a set of challenges meant to show beginners the basics of the two technologies mentioned above which are leading in the DevOps area nowadays.

## Projects
